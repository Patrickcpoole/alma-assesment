# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design choices and architecture of the [Project Name] application. It provides insights into the rationale behind various decisions, including technology choices, state management strategies, and performance optimizations.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular and component-based architecture, leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The key components of the architecture include:

- **Frontend:** Built with React (Next.js) for optimized rendering and routing.
- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for global state and React Query for server-state management.
- **UI Library:** Uses Material UI, RadixUI and Tailwind CSS for styling and component consistency.
- **Data Fetching:** React Query handles API requests and caching.

## Tech Stack & Justification

| Technology    | Purpose          | Justification                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Next.js       | Framework        | Provides SSR, SSG, and API routes                      |
| React         | UI Library       | Component-based structure for maintainability          |
| Redux Toolkit | State Management | Efficient and scalable state handling                  |
| React Query   | Server State     | Handles caching and async data fetching                |
| Material UI   | UI Components    | Pre-built, accessible components for rapid development |
| Tailwind CSS  | Styling          | Utility-first CSS framework for flexibility            |
| Radix UI      | UI Components    | Provides low-level, accessible components              |

## State Management

The project follows a hybrid state management approach:

- **Global State:** Managed with Redux Toolkit to handle user preferences and session data.
- **Server State:** Managed with React Query for efficient API requests and caching.

### Why Redux Toolkit?

- Centralized state management with built-in reducers and middleware.
- Scalable and predictable state flow.
- Improved developer experience with TypeScript support.

### Why React Query?

- Handles caching, background syncing, and pagination automatically.
- Reduces unnecessary API calls with smart data fetching strategies.
- Simplifies async state management without bloating Redux store.

## UI/UX Considerations

- **Radix UI** ensures accessibility and consistency in UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** provides flexibility for quick styling.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes.

## API & Data Flow

The application interacts with external APIs through the following approach:

1. **Fetching Data**: API calls are managed using React Query to fetch, cache, and sync data.
2. **State Management**: Data is either stored in Redux for global access or React Query cache for optimized fetching.
3. **Error Handling**: Custom error handlers ensure proper user feedback and logging.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Authentication was simulated using a Login form and Authentication context and provider. In a production app, we might implement OAuth, JWT-based authentication, or integrate with an identity provider like Auth0 or Firebase Authentication.

## Performance Optimizations

- **SSR & SSG**: Next.js pre-renders pages for better performance.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and images are loaded only when needed.
- **Code Splitting**: Reduces bundle size and improves page speed.
- **Caching & Memoization**: Uses React Queryâ€™s caching and memoization strategies.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Next.js `dynamic` function is used for client-side only components to improve performance. Example:
  ```javascript
  import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
  const Select = dynamic(() => import("react-select"), { ssr: false });
  ```

## Deployment Strategy (Future improvement)

- **Hosting**: Next.js app deployed on Vercel for seamless CI/CD.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployments.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed securely through `.env` files and Vercel secrets.

## Future Improvements

- Refactor UI components so that application is only using one library
- Implement WebSockets for real-time updates.
- Add unit and integration tests for improved reliability.
- Expand API integrations to support more use cases.
- Enhance accessibility features for a more inclusive experience.
